# 🗑️ Remove Available Courses Feature

## Overview
Users can now remove courses from the available courses list, which will also remove them from localStorage.

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Feature**: Remove available courses from UI and localStorage

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **New Hook Function: `removeAvailableCourse`**
- **Location**: `src/utils/hooks.js` → `useAvailableCourses` hook
- **Purpose**: Removes a course from available courses list
- **Updates**: Both React state and localStorage automatically

```javascript
const removeAvailableCourse = (courseId) => {
  setAvailableCourses((prev) => prev.filter((course) => course.id !== courseId));
  showNotification(
    "success",
    "Course Removed",
    "The course has been removed from available courses."
  );
};
```

### 2. **Delete Button in CourseCard**
- **Location**: `src/components/CourseCard.jsx`
- **Visual**: Small red X button in top-right corner
- **Behavior**: 
  - Only shows when `showDelete={true}` prop is passed
  - Prevents card click event (won't trigger course selection)
  - Calls `onDelete` callback with course ID

### 3. **Integration in AvailableCoursesModal**
- **Location**: `src/Modals/AvailableCoursesModal.jsx`
- **Props Added**: `onRemoveAvailableCourse`
- **Passes to**: CourseCard component with `showDelete={true}`

### 4. **HomePage Integration**
- **Location**: `src/Pages/HomePage.jsx`
- **Extracts**: `removeAvailableCourse` from hook
- **Passes to**: AvailableCoursesModal

## 📋 How It Works

### Data Flow
```
User clicks X button on course card
         ↓
CourseCard.handleDelete() called
         ↓
Stops event propagation (prevents card click)
         ↓
Calls onDelete(course.id)
         ↓
AvailableCoursesModal.onRemoveAvailableCourse()
         ↓
HomePage.removeAvailableCourse()
         ↓
useAvailableCourses hook
         ↓
setAvailableCourses (filters out course)
         ↓
useLocalStorage automatically saves
         ↓
localStorage updated
         ↓
Success notification shown
         ↓
UI re-renders without the course
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Remove a Course
1. Open the app
2. Add a course via "Add Course" button
3. Click "Select Available Course"
4. See your course with an X button in top-right
5. Click the X button
6. ✅ Course removed from list
7. ✅ Success notification appears
8. Refresh the page
9. ✅ Course stays removed (localStorage updated)

### Test 2: Event Propagation
1. Open "Select Available Course"
2. Click the X button on a course
3. ✅ Course is deleted (not selected)
4. Modal doesn't close
5. ✅ Only delete action occurs

### Test 3: Multiple Courses
1. Add 3-4 courses
2. Remove them one by one using X buttons
3. ✅ Each removal works independently
4. ✅ Remaining courses stay intact

### Test 4: Selected Course Removal
1. Add a course to available courses
2. Select it (add to your schedule)
3. Go back to "Select Available Course"
4. Remove the course using X button
5. ✅ Course removed from available list
6. ⚠️ Note: Course remains in your schedule
   (This is correct - you're removing from available, not from your schedule)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Props Flow

#### CourseCard Component
```javascript
<CourseCard
  course={course}              // Course object
  isSelected={isSelected}      // Boolean
  hasTimeSlots={hasTimeSlots}  // Boolean
  onClick={handleClick}        // Card click handler
  onDelete={onDelete}          // DELETE HANDLER (new)
  showDelete={true}            // SHOW DELETE BUTTON (new)
/>
```

#### AvailableCoursesModal Component
```javascript
<AvailableCoursesModal
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={onClose}
  availableCourses={availableCourses}
  selectedCourses={courses}
  onSelectCourse={selectCourse}
  onRemoveAvailableCourse={removeAvailableCourse}  // NEW PROP
/>
```

### Hook Export
```javascript
// Before
return {
  availableCourses,
  saveCourse,
};

// After
return {
  availableCourses,
  saveCourse,
  removeAvailableCourse,  // NEW
};
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### When to Remove Available Courses

1. **Course No Longer Offered**
   - Course cancelled or discontinued
   - Remove it from the system

2. **Wrong Course Added**
   - Accidentally added wrong course
   - Clean up available courses list

3. **Outdated Information**
   - Course information changed significantly
   - Remove and re-add with new info

4. **Testing/Development**
   - Clean up test data
   - Reset the available courses list

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Gets Removed
- ✅ Course from available courses list
- ✅ Course from localStorage (`availableCourses` key)
- ✅ UI updates immediately

### What Does NOT Get Removed
- ❌ Course from user's selected schedule
- ❌ If a user already selected this course, it stays in their schedule
- ❌ This only affects the "available courses pool"

### Why This Design?
- Users may want to keep courses they've already selected
- Removing from available courses is an admin action
- Removing from schedule is a user action (separate button)

---

## 🎨 UI Behavior

### Delete Button States

#### Normal State
- Red circular button with X
- Visible only in AvailableCoursesModal

#### Hover State
- Darker red background
- Cursor changes to pointer

#### Click Action
- Course immediately removed
- Smooth fade-out animation
- Success notification appears

---

## 🔄 localStorage Integration

### Before Removal
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('availableCourses')
// [
//   { id: 1, courseName: "CS101", ... },
//   { id: 2, courseName: "CS102", ... },
//   { id: 3, courseName: "CS103", ... }
// ]
```

### After Removing Course with id: 2
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('availableCourses')
// [
//   { id: 1, courseName: "CS101", ... },
//   { id: 3, courseName: "CS103", ... }
// ]
```

### Automatic Persistence
- `useLocalStorage` hook automatically saves
- No manual localStorage.setItem() needed
- Changes persist across page reloads
